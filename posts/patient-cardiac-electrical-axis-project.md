Worked with a sponsor from Boston Scientific to develop an application that analyzes patient ECG data and plots the patients cardiac electrical axis on the triaxial system. This tool will support clinical decision-making and enhance the detection of heart rhythm irregularities.

I was responsible for automated testing and coverage of the backend using Jenkins Continuous Integration. I achieved a coverage of 97% overall, including
99% for core mathematical functions and 96% for database operations
