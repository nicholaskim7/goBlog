I built a workout tracking application that allows users to log workout sessions and monitor personal records across devices. Key responsibilities included implementing secure user sign-in with Google OAuth 2.0 via Passport.js, enhancing performance by parallelizing API calls and optimizing database queries, and ensuring consistent uptime by configuring a service to ping the backend server regularly.

Check out the live application here:
